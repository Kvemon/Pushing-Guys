I (Kvemon) allow you to use this datapack on your maps. You can use the entire map as a whole. 
HOWEVER, if you use any materials from this map, you MUST mention me as the original creator of the map. 
Otherwise, if you don't do this, you're just a asshole. Do you even know how hard it is to create maps, datapacks, resource packs, locations???? 
Just respect my work and the work of others, and everything will be fine.

:)
